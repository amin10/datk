    The LeLann, Chang and Roberts algorithm for Leader Election in a Synchronous Unidirectional_Ring. 
    
    Each Process sends its identifier around the ring.

    If the incoming identifier is greater than its own, it keeps passing the identifier;
    if it is less than its own, it discards the incoming identifier;
