A Network of n processes arranged randomly at the vertices of a connected 
undirected line graph of size n. Additional pairs of vertices are connected
at random with a probability that is inversely proportional to the 
difference in their positions on the line.

For example, the Process at index 3 is guaranteed to be connected to the 
Process at index 4, and is more likely to be connected to the Process at 
index 5 than to the Process at index 8.
